                <h3>Career Objective</h3>
                    <p>An actor of extraordinary caliber, while also being a successful musical artist and producer.
                        The objective of all of the products I make is to create something that
                        adds to the beauty of all the art that came before me. I don't want to release
                        anything that doesn't have my full heart and soul.
